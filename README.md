# My Personal Project

## Diabetes Manager

As someone with Type 1 Diabetes, I *always* have to track and
calculate various numbers to know how much insulin I need to
give myself. At meal time, I have many things to consider:

1. How many carbs are in this meal?
2. What's my current blood sugar?
3. Based on the first two questions, how much insulin should I give myself?

Also, I need to measure and keep track of my blood sugar at various points
throughout the day to ensure it is not too high or too low.
Having an app that would tell me how much insulin to give, 
and that would also not only keep track of my blood sugar 
readings but also **tell me my averages** would help greatly in 
managing my diabetes.

## User Stories

As a user, I want to be able to add a new blood sugar
reading at a specified time and add it to a list of 
readings/times.

As a user, I want to be able to input my current blood
sugar, my insulin to carb ratio, the number of carbs in
a meal I'm about to eat, and by bolus insulin base
in order to calculate how much insulin I should give
myself before a meal.

As a user, I want to be able to view a graph of my blood
sugar readings, showing how they rise and fall.

As a user, I want to be able to calculate my average
blood sugar levels, overall and separated by time of
day.

As a user, I want to be able to export my data as a 
CSV or text file, so that I can save it and bring it 
to my doctor.

# My Personal Project

## <ins>Diabetes Manager</ins>

As someone with Type 1 Diabetes, I *always* have to track and
calculate various numbers to know how much insulin I need to
give myself. At meal time, I have many things to consider:

1. How many carbs are in this meal?
2. What's my current blood sugar?
3. Based on the first two questions, how much insulin should I give myself?

Also, I need to measure and keep track of my blood sugar at various points
throughout the day to ensure it is not too high or too low.
Having an app that would not only keep track of all my blood sugar 
readings but also **calculate various stats** from these readings help greatly in 
managing my diabetes. Some things it would calculate:

- Average blood sugar - overall and separated for different times (fasting, before or after meals)
- Time in range - for what percentage of inputs has my blood sugar been in the optimal range?
- When my blood sugar is highest - is it higher on certain days of the week? Before or after a specific meal?

This app could be used by myself and other diabetics to aid in management of the disease.


## User Stories

As a user, I want to be able to add a new blood sugar
reading and add it to a list of all my previously entered readings.

As a user, I want to be able to select a specific blood sugar reading
and view details about it (time of day, before or after a meal, etc.),
and also be able to edit or add more details to it.

As a user, I want to be able to view statistics about my average
blood sugar levels (overall and separated by time of
day), and my time in range.

As a user, I want to be able to input my current blood
sugar, my insulin to carb ratio, the number of carbs in
a meal I'm about to eat, and by bolus insulin base
in order to calculate how much insulin I should give
myself before a meal.

As a user, I want to be able to export my data as a 
CSV or text file, so that I can save it and bring it 
to my doctor.

As a user, before I quit the application, I want to be able to have the option
to save my logbook readings to a file.

As a user, when I start the application, I want to have the option to load my data
from a file.

- You can generate the first required action related to adding Xs to a Y by clicking the Add Log Book Entry button
  - You will be taken to a new panel to input information. Once done, click Add and then Return to Main Menu and the logbook will be updated with the new entry
- You can generate the second required action related to adding Xs to a Y by clicking one of the Show _____ readings only, to show only readings from the specified category
- You can also add notes to a reading by first selecting the reading displayed, typing in your notes, and then clicking the Add Notes button. To get the notes to display in the logbook, click the refresh button
- This project has two visual components:
  - The refresh button uses an image of a refresh symbol rather than the word Refresh
  - When the View Average button is clicked, you will be taken to a new panel that shows average blood sugar in each category, as well as a bar chart showing Time In Range (the percentage of readings that are either low, in range, or high)
- You can save the state of my application by clicking Save Log Book
- You can reload the state of my application by clicking Load Log Book
